This will be very short and sweet, so you can start learning in no time.

## Preparation
First you will need to get a basic knowledge about the topic that you want to learn. I use [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)'s XXXX in 100s for that. If there is no video about your topic, search for a short video that is a level higher of a topic that you need to know (If you need to learn Keylocak (open source identity and access management solution) for instance, look up OAuth (protocol that you will be using) first).

## We need to go deeper!

So, now you know what the thing that you need to know about is. It's time to learn a bit more. Find a tutorial series about the topic and follow it. Learn for a maximum of 2 hours. You will need to do that everyday until you know enough about it.

## A word about learning

Learn for a maximum of 2 hours a day. Preferably 1 hour.

You will normally need a couple of days to learn the topic.

If you are not building a project for your Github with a tutorial, do that after your learning, while you watch it again. Doing the thing that you see and hear about will cement your knowledge.

For a long run knowlage. You need to learn every day... for. the. rest. of. your. life.

## Cya!
